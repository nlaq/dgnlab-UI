# dgnlab-UI
GUI over [DNGLab](https://github.com/dnglab/dnglab) to convert raw image files to DNG (with or without lossless compression). Useful for users of cameras without lossless compression (like the Sony a7r II and a7r III or Leica SL, SL 2), or for those who just want to keep their images in DNG format.

To use it you MUST HAVE DNGLAB [https://github.com/dnglab/dnglab] INSTALLED. If you dowload a release [https://github.com/dnglab/dnglab/releases] make sure to install it (just copy the file) in ~/.local/bin or /usr/bin for Linux or /usr/local/bin for Mac OS (or create a symlink to that path).

For the gui just copy the release file [https://github.com/nlaq/dgnlab-UI/releases] to the ~/.local/bin or /usr/bin for linux and the .desktop file to ~/.local/share/applications/ or /usr/share/applications/ for Linux or to the Applications folder for Mac OS.
